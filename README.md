# Overview

This is the frontend for the TagIt program, which allows users to categorize and track their files on a centralized server.

## Important Note When Cloning

Due to Flutter engineers' exceptional brainpower, capital letters are not allowed in package names. Therefore, when cloning, make sure to clone to a directory that follows the naming spec shown [here](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec#name) (`tagit_frontend` should work).

## Usage
Use `flutter run -d <platform>` to run.
Use `flutter build <platform>` to build.
