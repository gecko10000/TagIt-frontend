# Overview

This is the frontend for the TagIt program, which allows users to categorize and track their files on a centralized server.

## Usage
Use `flutter run -d <platform>` to run.
Use `flutter build <platform>` to build.

Important note: when running or building for the web, you must specify `--web-renderer html`. Otherwise, the display does not work properly on Chromium (at least from my experience).
